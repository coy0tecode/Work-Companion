Work Companion
Alpha version 0.1


Registration Panel:
	
	* If this is your first time using the app, Registration Panel should be the first screen you see
	
	* Enter your information in the appropriate sections and click 'Register' when you're ready
	
	* Don't think too hard about which companion to choose... You can change it at any time
		- In the Menu Bar click Menu, navigate to Companion Style, and click on your preferred companion from the list
		
	* If you want to change your profile name or birthday, please see the respective processes below:
		- In file explorer, navigate to the app .exe's directory + \Profiles
			- Select the folder with your profile name and rename it to whatever you'd like
			
		- Inside the \Profiles directory, go into the folder with your profile name
			- Edit the birthday.txt file, but be sure to keep the same format for the birthday
			  (for example, keep the abbreviated day of the week (eg. Mon, Thu), time (00:00:00), and year (eg. 1984))
			  Failure to do so will cause an error when the app tries to determine if your birthday is today
			  
	* The Registration Panel can be accessed by clicking Menu, then Register New Profile in the Change Profile submenu
	
	
Profile Popup:

	* Click the profile you want to sign in to, then click Ok
		- If the profile is found, the app loads and you will then see the Main Panel (unless it's your birthday!)
		

Main Panel:

	* Welcome to the Main Panel! Pretty sparse I know.
	
	* From here you can navigate to the Break Panel and Notes Panel, just click the respective button
	
	
Break Panel:

	* The Break Panel allows you to create custom breaks from a series of pre-selected options
	
	* To create a break, you'll use the dropdown menus to choose parameters for the break you want
	
	* Make sure to click Save Break once you have chosen your preferred parameters from the drop down menus
		- Input a name for your break and then you will see it in the Saved Breaks drop down menu
		
	* When you select a break from the Saved Breaks drop down menu, this starts the Interval timer
		- After the selected Interval timer has elapsed, the break you created will pop up on your screen
			- Enjoy your break! (or click the Dismiss button or the 'X' in the top right of the pop up)
			
	* If you don't want to wait the Interval time you selected, you can click the Break Now button
		- Breaks on demand! All other parameters besides Interval are unchanged when clicking Break Now
		- Please note that this does not reset or remove the interval timer: You will still get a break pop up after the chosen interval
		
	* If you want to remove a break, select it from Saved Breaks and click the Delete Break button
	
	* You can edit individual break files in your profile directory under /Breaks
		- Please be careful editing the break files, as changing the number of lines or writing in a non-existent parameter value will cause an error
		
	* The Main Menu button returns you to the Main Panel
		

Notes Panel:

	* The Notes Panel lets you write, save, read and delete notes of your own creation
	
	* Write in whatever you want in the Note Entry box, and if you don't like it, click the Clear Text button to get rid of it all!
	
	* If you do like it, click on Save Note and you'll be prompted to enter a title
		- Your note will be saved as a text file under your profile directory + \Notes
		- You can edit this note simply by editing the text file in the \Notes directory
		
	* Once your note is saved, you will see it in Note Explorer window on the right side of the panel
		- Click on a note and then click the Read Note button to, well, read the note!
		- In a similar fashion, click on a note and then click the Delete Note button if you want to remove it
		
	* The Main Menu button returns you to the Main Panel
	
	
Menu Bar:

	* The Menu Bar has two primary headers: Menu and Help. Their functions will be briefly listed below
