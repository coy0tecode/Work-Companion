# Work-Companion
wxPython app in the vein of Workrave


Basic instructions can be found in the documentation.txt file, but it's very simple, you'll be able to figure it out.


Alpha Release/First Release/v 0.1:

Have never done a release or package through Github, wish me luck!
You'll notice that the layout and positioning in the app is currently very bad. I am not good at wx sizing, but I'm going to fix it and release another version.
All the logic in the app should work, I am not running into any errors during my testing. But if you find any, let me know!
Also, if you know wx and can provide any guidance on the sizing in the app, that would be greatly appreciated.

Release info:
* An app that works and runs and doesn't have errors and does some stuff for you oh boy
* Very barebones, it does not look pretty
* Sizing is all over the place. You'll have to resize the app window sometimes and the profile popup shows up in a weird spot. Sorry bout that.
* Closing the app does not actually exit the program, should be a simple fix coming in the near future (FIXED)
* Currently lots of stuff in one folder/location. Moving folders and files from the app location will probably break the program, so please don't.
* Looking into many improvements for the next release, just wanted to get this working version out there for now
